# Webpagetest Ruby Wrapper
This is a fork of the webpagetest-ruby gem, as it has not been maintained since 2015. It adds:
- support for basic auth
- enforces HTTPS requests with self-signed certs (it could be nice to add full SSL support at a later date, but for the current use, we don't need it)


This gem is a Ruby wrapper for the main features of [Webpagetest](http://www.webpagetest.org/) REST API.
Features included on the original gem (as of 2015):
- Run tests with all [specified](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/advanced-features/webpagetest-restful-apis#TOC-Parameters) parameters of the API.
- Check test status
- Get available test locations

This gem is inspired by [Susuwatari](https://github.com/moviepilot/susuwatari) gem, so several ideas were taken from there (it's like a rewrite with some modifications).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'webpagetest'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install webpagetest

## Usage
To run a test off of the public WebPageTest instance, all you require is an API key. You can ask for your own by emailing Patrick Meenan, like he explains in [Webpagetest docs](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/advanced-features/webpagetest-restful-apis).

To run a test off of the Flywheel private WebPageTest instance, you will need to use the API key assigned to our instance as well as a username and password for our instance. All Flywheel devs should have access to these in the Flywheel 1Pass vault.

Then you need to instantiate an object of the `Webpagetest` class and use it to interact with the API.

### Set up connection options for request

```ruby
connection_options = { 
  request: :basic_auth,
  response: :logger,
  adapter: :net_http,
  url: flywheels_private_webpagetest_instance,
  user: your_username,
  pass: your_password
}
```

### Instantiate WPT object

```ruby
require 'webpagetest'

wpt = Webpagetest.new(k: your_api_key, options: connection_options)
```

### Run test
When running a test, a `Response` object is returned, with the following available methods:

* `test_id`: the `id` assigned to the submitted test
* `status`: the status of the test (`nil` at the beginning)
* `result`: the result object (`nil` until the status is `:completed`)
* `raw`: the raw response of the request
* `get_status`: makes a test status request, and fetches the result when status is `:completed`

```ruby
response = wpt.run_test do |params|
    params.url = 'http://webpagetest.org' # The url to test
    params.runs = 3 # optional, default is 1 (full list of options: https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/advanced-features/webpagetest-restful-apis#TOC-Sample)
end
```

### Option #1 (if you do not have access to the response object, only the client)
```ruby
test_result = wpt.test_result(response.test_id)

# Test is running, so status must be requested
test_result.status => :running
test_result.result => nil

# When test is completed, status and result will be updated
test_result.status => :completed
test_result.result => {
                                         "id" => "190916_RC_8",
                                        "url" => "your-test-url",
                                    "summary" => "your-instance-url/results.php?test=190916_RC_8",
                                    "testUrl" => "your-test-url",
                                   "location" => "your-location",
                                       "from" => "Iowa, USA - <b>Chrome</b> - <b>Cable</b>",
                               "connectivity" => "Cable",
                                     "bwDown" => 5000,
                                       "bwUp" => 1000,
                                    "latency" => 28,
                                        "plr" => "0",
                                     "mobile" => 0,
                                  "completed" => 1568653286,
                                     "tester" => "your-tester-id",
                                   "testRuns" => 3,
                                     "fvonly" => false,
                           "successfulFVRuns" => 3,
                           "successfulRVRuns" => 3,
                                    "average" => {
                               "firstView" => { ... },
                               "repeatView" => { ... },
                               "statusCode" => 200,
                               "statusText" => "Test Complete"
                      }

# Test errored
test_result.status => :errored
test_result.result => nil
```

### Option #2 (if you do still have access to the response object)
```
# Test is running, so status must be requested
response.get_status # => :running

# When test is completed, status will be updated
response.get_status # => :completed

# Only after knowing that test is completed, the result is set
response.result.keys
[
    [ 0] "id",
    [ 1] "url",
    [ 2] "summary",
    [ 3] "testUrl",
    [ 4] "location",
    [ 5] "from",
    [ 6] "connectivity",
    [ 7] "bwDown",
    [ 8] "bwUp",

    [20] "status_code",
    [21] "status_text"
]

response.result.runs[1].firstView.loadTime # => 2051
```

### Get test result
In order to get a result based on a test `id`,  the same procedure as above must be done.
```ruby
test = wpt.test_result("some_test_id") # test is a Response object

response.test_id # => "131007_FC_WHR"

# Test could be running or completed
response.get_status # => :completed

response.result.average.firstView.domElements # => 714
```

### Locations
```ruby
locations = wpt.locations
locations.keys
[
    [  0] "Dulles_IE6",
    [  1] "Dulles_IE10",
    [  2] "Dulles:Chrome",
    [  3] "Dulles:Canary",
    [  4] "Dulles:Firefox",
    [  5] "Dulles_iOS",
    [  6] "Dulles_Android",
    [  7] "Dulles_Thinkpad:Chrome",
    [  8] "Dulles_Thinkpad:Canary",
    [  9] "Asheville_IE",
    [ 10] "Miami_IE8",
    [ 11] "Miami:Chrome",
    [ 12] "Miami:Firefox",
    ...
]
```
